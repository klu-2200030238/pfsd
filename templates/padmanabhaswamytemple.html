<h4>Gopurams:</h4>The Padmanabhaswamy Temple boasts a single, magnificent gopuram (gateway tower) that stands as a testament to the fusion of Kerala and Dravidian architectural styles. Built in the 16th century, this towering structure is roughly 100 feet (30 meters) high and features seven tiers. Unlike the colorful gopurams found in Tamil Nadu, the Padmanabhaswamy gopuram adheres to a more subdued color scheme, showcasing intricate carvings and sculptures on its surface. These carvings typically depict scenes from Hindu mythology, particularly stories related to Lord Vishnu, the presiding deity of the temple. The gopuram serves not only as a grand entrance but also as a symbolic gateway to the divine realm within the temple complex. The temple features several gopurams, with the main entrance being the eastern gateway, adorned with a towering gopuram.</br>
<h2>Dress Code:</h2>The Padmanabhaswamy Temple adheres to a specific dress code for visitors to maintain reverence within the sacred space. Here's a breakdown of what to wear:

Men: Traditionally, men are expected to wear a dhoti (mundu) - a long white cloth wrapped around the waist and reaching the ankles. An angavastra, a shoulder cloth, can be worn optionally. Shirts or kurtas are not permitted.</br>
Women: Women have more flexibility in recent times. While sarees are the most traditional and recommended attire, salwar kameez and churidar sets are also allowed now. However, in these cases, a dhoti (mundu) needs to be draped over the lower half of the body for entry. Young girls below 12 years old can wear gowns. It's important to remember that revealing clothing or skimpy outfits are strictly prohibited.There is a strict dress code for entering the temple premises. Men are required to wear dhoti (mundu) and no upper garment, while women are required to wear traditional attire such as saree or salwar kameez.</br>
<h4>Gopurams Heights: </h4>  The Padmanabhaswamy Temple stands out for its unique architectural style, blending Kerala and Dravidian influences. While many Dravidian temples boast towering gopurams (gateway towers) reaching staggering heights, the Padmanabhaswamy Temple features a single, majestic gopuram with a distinct characteristic - its manageable height.

Unlike its colorful cousins in Tamil Nadu that can reach heights exceeding 150 feet (45 meters), the Padmanabhaswamy Temple's gopuram stands at a respectful roughly 100 feet (30 meters) tall. This distinction reflects the architectural harmony of the temple complex. The focus here seems to be on intricate craftsmanship rather than overwhelming scale.

Despite its moderate height, the gopuram remains an impressive structure. Its seven tiers are adorned with exquisite carvings and sculptures depicting scenes from Hindu mythology, particularly stories related to Lord Vishnu. It effectively serves as a grand entranceway while maintaining a balance with the overall proportions of the temple.The eastern gopuram of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple is one of the tallest temple towers in Kerala, standing at around 30 meters (98 feet) high.</br>

<p>The Padmanabhaswamy Temple, located in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, is one of the most revered and architecturally significant temples in India. Dedicated to Lord Padmanabhaswamy, a form of Lord Vishnu, the temple stands as a masterpiece of Dravidian architecture, boasting intricate stone carvings, towering gopurams (gateways), and a majestic golden vimana (dome). The principal deity, Lord Padmanabhaswamy, is depicted in a reclining posture on the serpent Anantha, with Lord Brahma emerging from a lotus flower on his navel. The temple's history dates back several centuries, and it is mentioned in ancient texts like the Puranas. The temple was rebuilt in its present form in the 18th century by the Travancore royal family, who were devout patrons. It gained international attention in 2011 when treasure troves were discovered in its underground vaults, containing vast amounts of gold, jewels, and artifacts, making it one of the wealthiest religious institutions globally. The temple hosts various rituals and festivals throughout the year, attracting devotees and tourists from far and wide. The Padmanabhaswamy Temple stands not only as a symbol of religious devotion but also as a testament to the rich cultural heritage and architectural prowess of Kerala.</p>
